## Sample Dialogue Generated

```txt
A young couple was sitting on a fence in the country when a farmer 
noticed something amiss. The woman was bleeding terribly 
bleeding where the brain had been. Something had 
plucked that blood from her brain. He ran. 

But soon he caught up to her. She was bleeding so 
foul-up, he thought she was dead. 

...

A few hours later, the sleeper began to act strangely. He 
started talking again, but only in whispers. Then he started 
to scream. 

Every night he'd come to the door and scream, and the 
dogs would startle him and stop what they were doing. 
Now he was in his coffin. His head was in its coffin. 
But his arms and legs were around his coffin. 

"What do you come for?" the monster would ask. "What 
for?" 

And the woman and the dog would scream and run away. 

The man would be frightened to death. He thought the 
women and the dog would come after him. 

But they were gone. They had gotten away.

```txt
A few hours later, the hunter came out of her yard. She 
was wearing a pink waistcoat, a white shirt, and pink sandals. 
She had pink knee-high boots with nails in them, and she had 
a pink scarf wrapped around her head. She had a bunch of 
bundles of flowers and twigs around her neck. She carried 
a small vase of chrysanthemums. 

The police asked her husband why she had come out so 
early, but he said he had forgotten about her death. 

The hunter picked out a grave and brought it along. She 
lined it up, and when the grave was buried, she filled in the 
wider spot. Then the husband came out to meet her. He sat in 
the front seat of the police car, and she sat in the back. 

"I hope you're not going to haunt me," said the 
husband. 

"I hope so," she said, and she got out of the car and 
fell to the ground. "I'm glad I came out," she said.
